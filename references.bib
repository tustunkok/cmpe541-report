abstract = {This paper analyzes the form of two data serializing approaches used in web applications, XML and JSON. Considering that though both widely used, highly-efficient data transmission between these two methods is still a problem in application development. The features of these two data objects were analyzed and it was point out that how to translate correctly between these two objects. A recursive algorithm used to translate between these two types of data serializing forms was given based on the multi-tree data structure of XML and JSON objects. The efficiency of this algorithm was proved by translation experiments. When applied in web applications, this paper gives how to add the translation method in system structures of the applications. It gives how this method can improve system structure and the performance of the web applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {It is important to choose the most appropriate format for data representation that will result in best performance and meet all needed requests. Nowadays, XML and JSON are the two most commonly used formats for data representation and/or interchange. When switching from one format for data representation to another, existing converters can be used. In this paper, we describe a converter from XML to JSON format and vice versa that we developed. Subsequently, we compare our converter with an existing, publicly available converter. We found that there are some differences and difficulties in conversion when applying different converters. Some results of our comparison are presented here.},

@article{Nogatz2014,
abstract = {Despite its rising popularity as data format especially for web services, the software ecosystem around the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is not as widely distributed as that of XML. For both data formats there exist schema languages to specify the structure of instance documents, but there is currently no opportunity to translate already existing XML Schema documents into equivalent JSON Schemas. In this paper we introduce an implementation of a language translator. It takes an XML Schema and creates its equivalent JSON Schema document. Our approach is based on Prolog and CHR. By unfolding the XML Schema document into CHR constraints, it is possible to specify the concrete translation rules in a declarative way.},

abstract = {The data exchange efficiency of traditional XML is low and its versatility is poor, while JSON has a higher transmission efficiency compared with XML. As a lightweight data-interchange format, JSON is becoming more and more popular, but not as common as XML for its latter appearance in the application of web services. If we directly translate the XML data format into JSON data format, the original data will have format error. Since there is XML Schema Documents to validate XML format, and the JSON Schema to validate the JSON format. We can translate the XSD to its corresponding JSON Schema to make sure the translation from XML to JSON with no format error. So far, there is no much research on the translation from XSD into JSON Schema. In this paper we made a dictionary to translate every node of XSD to its equivalent JSON Schema format by unfolding the XSD. With some tests, we find the method can basically have a good translation result.},
