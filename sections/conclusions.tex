\section{Conclusions}
The popularity and usefulness of both JSON Schema and XSD make them great
candidates for data exchange and integrity checkers. However, converting one to
another can be challenging due to the lack of standardization in JSON Schema.
There are not many studies that provide such methods in the literature. The ones
that provide also describe bidirectional conversion methods i.e. from XSD to
JSON Schema or vice versa. The existing research has aged from 10 to 5 years
which might be considered a little bit old. There is not much research on the
utilization of trending machine learning topics to make the conversion. As
future work, these subjects can be possible candidates. A strong example that
proves those techniques work on this type of problem can be Github Copilot
\autocite{Copilot}.
